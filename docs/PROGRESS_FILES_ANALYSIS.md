   - Created by: `rebuild_progress.py` script

### üîç Why Statistics Were Confusing

1. **Two Different Systems**: Legacy vs Turbo tracking different progress
2. **Duplicate Processing**: Turbo system shows 425,989 success entries vs 376,882 total files
3. **Different File References**: Dashboard was reading legacy file while turbo was active
4. **Massive Skipping**: Turbo shows 412,245 skipped files (files already existed)

### üöÄ Current Active System

**Turbo Mode Progress**:
- **Real Progress**: 83.9% complete (316,034 / 376,882)
- **New Downloads**: 13,744 files actually downloaded
- **Already Existed**: 412,245 files were skipped (already on disk)
- **Active**: Last updated 30 minutes ago

### üìä Dashboard Configuration

The dashboard has been updated to:
- ‚úÖ Read from `download_progress_turbo.json` (active file)
- ‚úÖ Handle duplicate entries in turbo mode correctly
- ‚úÖ Show accurate progress percentage (83.9%)
- ‚úÖ Display turbo mode status
- ‚úÖ Calculate proper remaining files count

### üîß Backup Management

**Backup Creation**:
- Triggered by: `rebuild_progress.py` script
- Format: `download_progress_turbo_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
- Purpose: Recovery when progress file becomes corrupted
- Location: Same directory as main progress files

**When Backups Are Created**:
1. Before rebuilding corrupted progress files
2. When running recovery tools
3. Manual backup before major operations

### üéØ Recommendations

1. **Use Turbo Progress**: Dashboard now correctly uses `download_progress_turbo.json`
2. **Monitor Active System**: Focus on turbo statistics (83.9% complete)
3. **Archive Legacy File**: `download_progress.json` can be archived as it's no longer active
4. **Backup Management**: Keep recent backups, archive older ones

### üìà Current Status Summary

- **Total Files**: 376,882
- **Processed**: 316,034 (83.9%)
- **Actually Downloaded**: 13,744 new files  
- **Skipped (Already Existed)**: 412,245 files
- **Remaining**: ~60,848 files
- **System**: Turbo Mode (Active)
- **ETA**: ~1-2 hours (at current turbo speed)

The confusion was caused by having two parallel download systems running with different progress tracking. The dashboard now correctly shows the active turbo system progress.
