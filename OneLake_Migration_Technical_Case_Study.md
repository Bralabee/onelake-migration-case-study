## 2. Research & Investigation Phase

### 2.1 API Architecture Analysis

#### Initial Hypothesis Testing
We systematically tested multiple API approaches:

**Attempt 1: Fabric REST API**
```python
# Initial approach using Fabric API
base_url = "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/items/{lakehouse_id}/files"
# Result: HTTP 404 errors, endpoint not found
```

**Attempt 2: Azure Blob Storage API**
```python
# Blob Storage pattern
base_url = "https://{account}.blob.core.windows.net/{container}"
# Result: Authentication scope mismatch
```

**Attempt 3: Data Lake Gen2 API (Breakthrough)**
```python
# Correct OneLake pattern discovered
base_url = "https://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/{workspace_id}/{lakehouse_id}"
# Result: ✅ SUCCESS!
```

#### Authentication Scope Discovery
Through systematic testing, we identified the correct authentication requirements:

- **Wrong Scope:** `https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/.default`
- **Correct Scope:** `https://storage.azure.com/.default`

### 2.2 OneLake API Pattern Research

#### Critical API Discovery: Create-Append-Flush Sequence
After extensive testing, we discovered OneLake requires a specific 3-step process:

```python
# Step 1: Create file resource
PUT https://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/{workspace}/{lakehouse}/{path}?resource=file

# Step 2: Append data
PATCH https://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/{workspace}/{lakehouse}/{path}?action=append&position=0
Content-Length: {file_size}
Body: {file_content}

# Step 3: Flush/commit
PATCH https://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/{workspace}/{lakehouse}/{path}?action=flush&position={file_size}
```

This pattern was not clearly documented and required extensive experimentation to discover.

---

## 3. Debugging Methodology

### 3.1 Systematic API Testing Approach

#### Phase 1: Single File Validation
```python
# test_onelake_api.py - Diagnostic tool
def test_single_file_upload():
    """Test all possible API patterns with a single file"""
    test_patterns = [
        "fabric_rest_api",
        "blob_storage_api", 
        "data_lake_gen2_api"
    ]
    # Systematically test each pattern
```

#### Phase 2: Authentication Scope Testing
```python
def test_authentication_scopes():
    """Test different OAuth scopes"""
    scopes = [
        "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/.default",
        "https://storage.azure.com/.default",
        "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"
    ]
    # Test each scope with working API pattern
```

#### Phase 3: Parameter Validation
- Tested various query parameters (`resource=file`, `resource=directory`)
- Validated header requirements (`x-ms-version`, `Content-Length`)
- Experimented with path encoding and special characters

### 3.2 Error Analysis & Pattern Recognition

#### HTTP Status Code Analysis
```
404 Not Found → Wrong API endpoint
401 Unauthorized → Wrong authentication scope
403 Forbidden → Insufficient permissions
409 Conflict → Resource already exists (acceptable)
200/201 Success → Correct pattern identified
```

#### Response Header Analysis
```python
# Analyzing response headers revealed OneLake requirements
response.headers['x-ms-request-id']  # Tracking requests
response.headers['x-ms-version']     # Required API version
```

### 3.3 Breakthrough Discovery Process

#### The "Eureka" Moment
After 50+ API test iterations, we discovered the working pattern:

```python
# Working OneLake upload pattern
async def upload_file_onelake(file_path, onelake_path):
    # 1. Create with correct URL format
    create_url = f"https://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/{workspace_id}/{lakehouse_id}/{encoded_path}?resource=file"
    
    # 2. Use Azure Storage authentication scope
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {azure_storage_token}"}
    
    # 3. Follow create-append-flush sequence
    # This combination was the key to success
```

#### Key Design Principles
1. **Resumability:** Track progress, handle interruptions
2. **Scalability:** Concurrent uploads, efficient batching
3. **Reliability:** Automatic retries, error recovery
4. **Monitoring:** Real-time progress, comprehensive logging

### 4.2 Production Implementation Features

#### Automatic Token Refresh System
```python
class TokenManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.token_refresh_minutes = 45
        self.last_refresh = datetime.now()
    
    def ensure_valid_token(self):
        if self.is_token_expired():
            return self.refresh_access_token()
        return True
    
    def refresh_access_token(self):
        # Automatic PowerShell script execution
        # Seamless token renewal during long migrations
```

#### Smart Progress Tracking
```python
progress_data = {
    "total_files": 376888,
    "uploaded_files": 0,
    "failed_files": 0, 
    "skipped_files": 0,
    "completed_files": {
        "file_path": {
            "status": "completed",
            "size": file_size,
            "timestamp": timestamp,
            "batch": batch_number
        }
    }
}
```

#### Concurrent Upload Engine
```python
# Optimized for maximum throughput
MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS = 20
BATCH_SIZE = 100
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 120

async def upload_batch(files_batch):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [upload_file(session, file) for file in files_batch]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

### 4.3 Error Handling & Recovery

#### Multi-Layer Error Recovery
```python
def upload_with_retry(file_info):
    for attempt in range(RETRY_ATTEMPTS):
        try:
            result = upload_file(file_info)
            if result.status == "success":
                return result
        except TokenExpiredError:
            refresh_token()
            continue
        except NetworkError:
            await asyncio.sleep(exponential_backoff(attempt))
            continue
    return {"status": "failed", "exhausted_retries": True}
```

    if avg_size < 1_000_000:  # Small files
        return 100
    elif avg_size < 10_000_000:  # Medium files  
        return 50
    else:  # Large files
        return 20
```

#### Memory Management
```python

        chunk_size = 8192
        async for chunk in f:
            await upload_chunk(chunk)
```

### 5.3 Production Monitoring

#### Real-Time Dashboard
```python
class MigrationMonitor:
    def display_status(self):
        print(f"Progress: {uploaded:,}/{total:,} files ({pct:.1f}%)")
        print(f"Rate: {files_per_second:.1f} files/second")
        print(f"ETA: {estimated_completion}")
        print(f"Success Rate: {success_rate:.1f}%")
```

## 7. Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### 7.1 API Integration Insights

#### OneLake Specific Learnings
1. **Authentication Scope Critical:** Must use Azure Storage scope, not Fabric API scope
2. **API Pattern Specificity:** Data Lake Gen2 pattern required, not Blob Storage
3. **Three-Step Process:** Create-Append-Flush sequence is mandatory
4. **URL Format Precision:** Exact URL structure required for success

#### General API Development
1. **Systematic Testing:** Test one variable at a time
2. **Response Analysis:** Headers contain crucial debugging information  
3. **Error Code Patterns:** HTTP status codes reveal specific issues
4. **Documentation Gaps:** Real-world testing often required for complex APIs

### 7.2 Production System Design

#### Scalability Principles
```python
# Design for scale from day one
class ProductionMigrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_concurrency = 20      # Based on API limits
        self.batch_size = 100          # Optimal for most file sizes
        self.retry_attempts = 3        # Balance speed vs reliability
        self.progress_save_interval = 1 # Save after each batch
```

#### Reliability Patterns
1. **Idempotent Operations:** Safe to retry any operation
2. **Progress Checkpointing:** Regular state persistence
3. **Graceful Degradation:** Reduced performance vs total failure
4. **Automatic Recovery:** Self-healing system design
