# 1. Navigate to project
cd Commercial_ACA_taskforce

# 2. Activate environment  
conda activate aca_taskforce_env

## 🎯 Current Project State

### ✅ What Works Right Now
- **Environment:** `aca_taskforce_env` conda environment is configured
- **Authentication:** PowerShell token generation script
- **Migration Engine:** `onelake_migrator_turbo_working.py` is validated
- **Monitoring:** Dashboard available at `http://localhost:8051`
- **Configuration:** Valid workspace and lakehouse IDs in `config/.env`

### ⚠️ Important Current Situation
**Files Already Exist in OneLake!** 
- Previous migration was 100% successful (376,888 files)
- Re-running migration will show 0% success (conflict errors)
- This is expected behavior - not a failure

## 🔧 Choose Your Mission

### Mission 1: Test Connectivity (Recommended First)
```bash
# Quick API test
python onelake_migrator_turbo_working.py
# Look for: "SUCCESS: Uploaded: test_upload/test_api_working.py"
```

### Mission 2: Monitor Existing Files
```bash
# Start monitoring dashboard
python src/monitoring/simple_dashboard.py
# View at: http://localhost:8051
```

### Mission 3: Production Migration (if needed)
```bash
# High-performance migration with 10 workers
python src/fabric/onelake_migrator_turbo_fixed.py --workers 10
```

## 🔍 What You'll See

### Success Indicators
```bash
✅ ACCESS TOKEN VALID - Expires: XX/XX/2025 XX:XX:XX
✅ Scanned 376,888 files in 25.4s (14817 files/sec)
✅ SUCCESS: Uploaded: test_upload/test_api_working.py (8,485 bytes)
```

### Expected "Failures" (Files Already Exist)
```bash
📊 Progress: X.X% | Speed: XXX files/sec | Success: 0/50
# This means files already exist - not actual failures!
```

### Dashboard View
- **Success count:** 375,993 (from previous migration)
- **Total files:** 376,888
- **Progress:** Monitoring existing migration state

## 🚨 Common Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Token Expired
```bash
# Symptoms: 401 Unauthorized errors
# Solution: Generate fresh token
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts/powershell/get_access_token.ps1"
```

### Fix 2: Wrong Directory
```bash
# If you see "can't open file" errors
# Make sure you're in the right directory:
Get-Location
# Should show: ...\Commercial_ACA_taskforce
```

### Fix 3: Environment Not Active
```bash
# Activate the correct conda environment
conda activate aca_taskforce_env
python -c "import aiofiles; print('✅ Ready')"
```

## 📋 Essential Commands

### Token Management
```bash
# Generate new token (do this first!)
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts/powershell/get_access_token.ps1"

# Check token expiry in logs
# Look for: "Token expires: XX/XX/2025 XX:XX:XX"
```

### Migration Commands
```bash
# Validated working version (single file test)
python onelake_migrator_turbo_working.py

# Production turbo version (10 workers)
python src/fabric/onelake_migrator_turbo_fixed.py --workers 10

# Resume from previous run
python src/fabric/onelake_migrator_turbo_fixed.py --resume
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Start dashboard
python src/monitoring/simple_dashboard.py

# Enhanced monitoring
python src/monitoring/enhanced_dashboard.py

# Check progress files
ls *progress*.json
```

## 🆘 Emergency Troubleshooting

### Problem: Nothing Works
```bash
# Nuclear option - reset everything
cd Commercial_ACA_taskforce
conda activate aca_taskforce_env
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts/powershell/get_access_token.ps1"
python onelake_migrator_turbo_working.py
```

### Problem: Can't Generate Token
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify you're on corporate network/VPN
3. Confirm Azure AD permissions
4. Try running PowerShell as administrator

### Problem: Import Errors
```bash
# Fix Python environment
conda activate aca_taskforce_env
pip install aiofiles aiohttp asyncio pathlib
```

## 📞 Getting Help

### Check These First
1. **Token Status:** Look for token expiry in command output
2. **Environment:** Confirm `(aca_taskforce_env)` is shown in terminal
3. **Directory:** Make sure you're in `Commercial_ACA_taskforce`
4. **Files Exist:** Remember - 0% success often means files already uploaded!

### Log Files to Check
- `onelake_migration_working.log` - Migration logs
- `migration_progress_working.json` - Progress tracking
- Terminal output - Real-time status

### Key Status Messages
- ✅ "SUCCESS: Uploaded:" = Working correctly
- 📊 "Success: 0/50" = Files already exist (normal!)
- ❌ "401 Unauthorized" = Token expired (fix with new token)
- ❌ "can't open file" = Wrong directory
